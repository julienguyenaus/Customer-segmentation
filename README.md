# Customer-segmentation
Segmenting customers through the application of clustering algorithms and association rule mining using Python

## 1. Problem Formulation
Traditional customer segmentation methods based on demographics and simple rules often lead to broad, ineffective marketing. In todayâ€™s data-rich and competitive market, businesses need AI-driven solutions that can uncover complex customer behaviors for more personalized engagement.

This project addresses that need by applying clustering algorithms and association rule mining to segment customers and identify purchasing patterns:

Clustering (e.g., K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models): Groups customers based on behavior and purchase history.

Association Rule Mining: Reveals frequently bought item combinations to support cross-selling and upselling.

Feature Engineering & Evaluation: Enhances model accuracy with meaningful features like purchase frequency, product variety, and department preferences.

These approaches help businesses better understand customer needs, improve targeting, and optimize marketing strategies.
